Since 2020-10-17 the Scorex project requires all commits to be signed off.

The sign-off process we require is present in the Linux kernel documentation[0].

This file contains past contributions that we expect to retroactively be marked as
signed off by their corresponding authors with a signed off commit.

To mark contributions in this file as signed off, the contributor must prepend
"Signed-off-by: " to their author line. With this they acknowledge the DCO[1]
for all their past commits to the project, listed below their author line.

For example, the following line
      Jane Doe <janedoe@example.com> (42):
would be turned into
      Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <janedoe@example.com> (42):

The commit that contains this change must of course be signed off.
Note that you may hold multiple aliases, so make sure you sign off contributions
from all your aliases.
