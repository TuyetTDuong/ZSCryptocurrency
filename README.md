Zero-sum Cryptocurrency System: A New Approach to Design a Scalable Blockchain Protocol
Author: Tuyet Duong

1, Abstract

We degisn a Zero-sum blockchain, the first scalable blockchain that combines proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms in a secure and scalable way so that the blockchain system can achieve both security (from PoW) and scalability (from PoS). Different from ordinary blockchain design, this work proposes a novel approach to improve throughput of current blockchain protocols.

The Zero-sum blockchain is developed from a recent provably secure PoW/PoS hybrid blockchain by Duong et al. (ESORICS 2020). To achieve security, scalability, and stability, we enhance the blockchain structure and also the difficulty adjustment in both PoW and PoS chains so that our blockchain system has the Zero-sum property.
